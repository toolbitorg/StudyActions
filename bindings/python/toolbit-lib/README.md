# Toolbit library for Python
[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/toolbit-lib.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/toolbit-lib)

The target device of this library is **Toolbit DMM**, digital multimeter, that is used with PC to measure DC voltage or current.

The target version of this library is as follows:
  * Python: *3.6 or later*


# Installation

The toolbit-lib package is published to the PyPI repository. It can be installed by the following steps:

### Ubuntu linux / Raspberry Pi
```shell
  sudo apt install libudev-dev
  pip3 install toolbit-lib
```

### macOS
```shell
  pip3 install toolbit-lib
```

### Windows
```shell
  pip3 install toolbit-lib
```

# Usage

### Example

Connect your device to USB port and execute the following code:

```python
from toolbit import Dmm

dmm = Dmm()
dmm.open()
print(str('%03.3f' % dmm.getVoltage()) + " [V]")
print(str('%03.3f' % (1000.0 * dmm.getCurrent())) + " [mA]")
```

Result will be shown as follows:
```shell
1.500 [V]
0.000 [mA]
```
